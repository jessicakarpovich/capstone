# Brief

Teenagers and young adults with an interest in Japanese culture often decide to study Japanese. However, as they tend to study using no one platform, the knowledge they gain is random and finding a single app that allows them to grow in a direction they want is difficult. This Sashimi Ninja app will serve as a single app that can be used to study Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. It will integrate outside resources to provide additional information about the language and to implement a translate feature.

## Audience

Teenagers and young adults, primarily high school and college students, between the ages of 15 and 25 with interest in Japanese culture, want to study Japanese while skipping content that they already know. They have some knowledge of Japanese that they gained from playing games, watching anime, or reading manga. Their primary reason for wanting to learn the language is to play more games, and enjoy manga and anime without the need of translation. 

As this is primarily a hobby, they tend to study in bursts whenever time allows.

### Primary Audience

They are comfortable with tecnhology and may even know how to hack their way to play an old game that they like. That said, they only choose ad-free apps that are available for free download.

### Secondary Audience

They are not as comfortable with technology and tend to get a little lost when first using an app. Any app they deem too complex is dropped.

## Problem

### Primary Problem

There is no free, good quality app to study Japanese that gives users the freedom of choosing what content to review. Most apps are either costly, of low quality, or lock the user into a lesson plan. Even if the app allows a user to test out of a section of content, that is still time the user had to invest before reaching their goal. This can be very frustrating to a user that is busy and just wants to find out if the app will even work for them.

One user I interiviewed said, "I tried several apps, but most of the free ones have ads, which is annoying. On top of that, they usually cover only Hiragana, Katakana or they word questions in romaji so I never get to practice reading Japanese."

Another user mentioned that he has some prior knowledge of Japanese but most apps enforce a lesson plan and don't provide a general overview of the content. To view something specific, you have to go through a whole lesson.

### Secondary Problem

The other issue is that many apps dump a user into review mode with no explanations. That's fine if the user knows what they're looking at, but with if their knowledge is more in spoken, and not written, Japanese? It's even worse when the app only covers part of the Japanese language or writing system, without of explaining how it all comes together.

## Solution

### Competition

[Real Kana](https://realkana.com/) offers lesson-free review for kana. However, it has ads and it forces the user to type their answer to each question. Although that forces the user to know the answer, on mobile, the experience is better with multiple choice.

[Erin's Challenge](https://www.erin.ne.jp/en/) is a free app that has plenty of resources on Japanese, but the app's questions are primarily in romaji and it locks the user into lessons. 

[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is also available for free and covers vocabulary, grammar, and writing. However, it never gives a breakdown of the writing system and it glosses over many details of the language.

### My Solution

My solution is to create a free app (no ads) that will cover kana (Hiragana and Katakana), kanji, and simple phrases. It will have review, test, and resources sections. 

In review, I will display kana by row and kanji by category. Each character will be listed with the readings and meanings (kanji only). This section will allow the user to review the content and will serve as a way for the user to quickly refresh their memory if they forget something.

The test section will allow the user to select which kana rows and what kanji levels they want to be included in the questions. There will also be options to select the number of questions and what language the questions are displayed in. This way a beginner in Japanese will be able to start practicing with questions in English or romaji, while an intermediate user will be able to select Japanese to challenge themselves.

The resources section will provide kana charts, a translation feature, and guides on getting started in Japanese. It will be aimed at giving an overview of the language, so that if the user has never formally studied Japanese, they will know what to expect.

#### Address Primary Audience

They only consider free apps with no ads and excess clutter so I will be making my app freely available and only adding elements that directly contribute to functionality. As they are tech savy individuals, I will be following standard design choices with primary navigation handled as tab navigation.

#### Address Secondary Audience

As they are not as comfortable with tech and may need an extra push to figure out how to use a new app, I have added a '?' icon link to every main page at the top that redirects to the resources screen (it can also be accessed through the tab navigation). This screen has the translator, kana charts, and links on getting started; all great resources on starting with Japanese and understanding the app's purpose.

The translator feature uses the Google Translator API and I have added a toggle, which allows you to select what language to translate to: Japanese or English. The language of the search query is auto-detected. This means people can use the translator feature to translate from any language. It is especially useful when the user's primary language is other than English.

## Unique Value Proposition

Sashimi Ninja will be superior to all its competition because of the following key reasons:

* free (no ads)
* clean, tested design
* no login/signup/pre-requisites required
* if logged in, saved progress - if time allows
* review section - kana, kanji
* test section - user selects question, content and language
* resources section - translation, kana charts, getting started guides
