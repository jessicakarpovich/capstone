- review mode
- test mode
- no pre-qualifications for accessing highest level difficulty

**User stories**

1. My favorite manga isn't getting an offical translation and the team scanlating it, has dropped it. I would love to finish the story, but first need to improve my Japanese reading skills. I've bought the raws and it has Furigana over the difficult Kanji, so I'll be ready to go once I can fluently read Hiragana, Katakana and the basic Kanji. Most apps I've found, focus on either Kana or Kanji. I would like a single app that lets me pick-and-choose what I want to review.

2. I've studied Japanese a couple of years ago and now I want to review before starting to play a Japanese game. Most apps force me to start at the beginning before giving me access to higher difficulties. I know the basics so this is frustrating. Isn't there a way for me to review just what I need?
